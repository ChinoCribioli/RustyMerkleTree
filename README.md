# Rusty Merkle Tree

This is my implementation of a Merkle Tree in Rust. The main goal of this project was to learn the basic concepts of Rust while implementing a fun and useful data structure used in cryptography. It took me about 2 weeks.

As usual in Cargo projects, you can run it with the command `cargo run` and run the modest test suite with `cargo test`.
